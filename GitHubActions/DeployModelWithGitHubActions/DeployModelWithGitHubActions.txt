====

• Deploy a model to a managed endpoint.
• Trigger model deployment with GitHub Actions.
• Test the deployed model.


You can use the Azure Machine Learning CLI (v2) to deploy trained machine learning models automatically as part of machine learning operations (MLOps).

• Register the model.
• Deploy the model.
• Test the deployed model.

1. When a machine learning model needs to generate predictions on new data every week, what is the appropriate model deployment?
A: Batch endpoint
Correct. Use batch endpoints when you want to generate a batch of predictions.


2. Which assets will be autogenerated when using no-code deployment with an MLflow model?
A:  The scoring script and environment.
Correct. When a model is logged with MLflow, the scoring script and environment are created by the Azure Machine Learning workspace during deployment.
