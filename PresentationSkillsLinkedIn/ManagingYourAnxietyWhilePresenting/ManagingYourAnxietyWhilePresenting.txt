Calm and confident presenting 

M1: public speaking anxiety
=====
Deep breath

Belly breath

Slow down the gesture

If I forget what to say

Back pocket question


If you blank out, why does it help to repeat what you just said?
A: It often will remind you of what you intended to say next.
We are often able to remember what we just said even when we forget what we want to say next. This can often get you back on track.

How can a "back pocket question" help you if you blank out when presenting?
A: It gives you time to collect your thoughts. 
Correct 
Asking a question distracts your audience just long enough for you to refer to your notes or collect your thoughts. 


You're starting a presentation and you begin to perspire or blush. What strategy helps the most?
A: Hold something cold in your hands.

When you are about to start a presentation and you begin to get shaky hands and/or legs, what can you do to reduce this shakiness?
A: Use big, broad gestures. 
Correct 
Big broad gestures allow you to give the adrenaline running through your body a place to go. 


M2: public speaking anxiety source
====
Write down the list causing nervous

Visualize your presentation

How does becoming present-oriented combat fear of negative potential future outcomes?
A: 
It prevents us from worrying about the future. 
Correct 
Being absorbed in the present does not allow us cognitive resources to worry about the future. 


Why does thinking about the future increase anxiety?
A: 
Focusing on potentially failing to achieve our goals increases stress. 
Correct 
Whenever we speak, we have goals and our fear of not achieving these goals spikes our anxiety. 

How can you desensitize yourself to the anxiety that comes up when you are being judged by others?
A: 
Visualize yourself doing the presentation, prior to it occuring. 
Correct 
Visualizing allows you to get comfortable presenting prior to delivering your speech. This means you will have had an experience of presenting prior to actually doing it. 


How does redirecting your audience's attention help you to feel less nervous?
A: 
It gives you time to collect your thoughts.. 
Correct 
Redirecting your audience offers you some time to collect your thoughts and take a deep breath. Note that back-pocket questions have the same effect. 


By asking how likely the fear is to come true, you rationalize your fear of speaking. Why does this often help you feel less nervous?
A: 
You realize that most of the time, you won't encounter that fear. 
Correct 
Because fear is often irrational, we catastrophize the likelihood of negative outcomes occurring. In reality, they are often not very likely. 


How does writing down your fears about public speaking help you feel less nervous?
A: 
It allows you to rationally review your fears and determine how likely they are to actually occur. 
Correct 
Writing out your fears affords you the opportunity to objectively and rationally evaluate them. 


M3: behaviors to avoid
=====

3 P

procrastination  
Perfectionism
Powerpoint

Don't memorize 

Create an outline

Bulleted list 

Question based 

Record yourself

What kind of outlines can be used in place of memorizing?
A: bullet-point or question-based

Why does memorization cause more anxiety?
A: 
Memorizing creates a "right" way to say what you intend to say and this invokes a lot of stress to say it this way. 
Correct 
Our cognitive load becomes overwhelming when we need to process the input of the audience and try to remember and recite everything we have written. 


Why does focusing first on slides tend to increase speaking anxiety?
A: 
It takes time away from creating your story and practicing it. 
Correct 
Having an audience centered talk track is critical to public speaking success. Creating slides without a clear story outline first distract you from your primary task of being in service of your audience. 


How can you avoid procrastinating when preparing and practicing a presentation?
A: 
Publically commit to a plan and reward yourself when you achieve each milestone. 
Correct 
A publicly committed to plan with rewards along the way help keep you focused and allow other to support you along the way.
