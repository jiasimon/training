Introduction to Generative AI with GPT

What is GPT?
A: software that can generate text and images based on prompting from a user


How does GPT generate text that appears to have been written by a human?
A: by processing large amounts of data from the internet

Given OpenAI's principles in its charter, how should it approach an AGI project emerging from a competitor that incentivizes speed over safety?
A: It will assist the competitor.
Correct
Instead of competing, OpenAI would assist the former competitor to focus on safety.


Why did OpenAI drop its designation as a nonprofit?
A: in order to grow the organization by attracting further investment
Correct
Microsoft has since stepped forward and invested $1 billion into OpenAI.

How does the approach described as "machine learning," or ML, work?
A: Statistical techniques are applied to large sets of data.

In a general sense, what is AI?
A: machines imitating intelligent human behavior

How does natural language processing (NLP) generally begin pre-processing a text input?
A: by tokenizing the sentences and breaking them into individual words

GPT can generate software code based on a plain language input
A: true

What is a prompt engineering technique for producing higher quality output?
A: providing specific context and guidance


In GPT, in addition to algorithyms, humans also train the system to produce text output
A: TRUE
Correct
Called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or RLHF, GPT is provided with feedback by a person.


A large language model (LLM)
A: contains parameters
Correct
An LLM contains the parameters that identify the text that should be produced.

What is the AI alignment problem?
A: ensuring that AI goals are aligned with human goals to reduce a miscommunication that could have serious consequences

A neural network is software designed to learn from
A: finding patterns in data sets

The risks of AI for an organization include
A: not having the training and skills to take advantage of it

What is generative modeling?
A: predicting what the next word in a sentence should be based on previous words in the sentence


What's one of the best ways to improve the quality of an output?
A: Rephrase the input text


If Sonia's company is considering creating in-house AI solutions, it may need to add several new roles. Why would her company hire some skilled software engineers?
