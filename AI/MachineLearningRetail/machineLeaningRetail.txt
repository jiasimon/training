M2: Machine learning in reatail
=====

Gartner AI-specific Trends 2021

Hyperautomation


Use Case of ML in Retail:
Predict customer behaviour

Visual and voice search

Chatbots

Price and inventory predictions


Clean and prepare data,

Visual search,
Customer provided image -> pre-trained CNN -> Feature Vector -> KNN Search -> Similar images


Voice search

Smart assistant

Gift when you need by 1-800-Flowers.com

Forecast: antidiabetic

 holiday adjustment, seasonal adjustment 

Theft prevention

Image similarity search

CNNs

Viewing an image

Two kinds of layers
1) Convolution: local receptive field
2) Pooling : Subsampling of inputs



Typical CNN architecture


Cos 90 =0

0 means no similarity

Vectors A and B are parallel

Cos 0 = 1

Opposite vectors

180 degrees


Challenges:
Insufficient data

Data bias

Lack of expertise

Deploy and forget



M3: optimizing product prices
=====
Law of demand

price elasticity of Demand


supply and demand

Myntra : leading Indian fashion e-commerce


LSTM RNNs

ARIMI model
LSTM RNNs



M4: optimizing supply planning
=====
VRP: Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

setting up the VRP

VRP virants:

VRPP: Vehicle Routing Problem  with Profits

VRPPD: Vehicle Routing Problem  with Pickup and Delievery


VRPTW: Vehicle Routing Problem  with Time Windows

CVRP: Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem


DVRP: Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem 

Industry 4.0



three stages:
cluster-first

route-second

route-improvement third


three stage algorithm and results

K-means clusering




M5: Apply machine learning to reatail data
======
association rules learning

frequent itemset


market basket analysis
identify items sold together


strong rules: rules with support and confidence that exceed threholds for minimum support and minimum confidence
if X then Y

recoomendations, cross sell, up-sell 

support, confidence, lift , conviction

itemsets

frequent itemsets

Rule A => C
is different
Rule C => A


Apriori Algorithm to find frequent itemsets



powerset

use breadth first and hash tree,
bottom up approach to generate candidate frequent sets

retail_dataset.shape

retail_dataset.info()


retail_dataset.head(10)




rules and strong rules

if X then Y

string rules supported by probability

recommendation,
cross-sell



evaluation association rules



rule :  A=> C

{beer}  =>  {diapers}
