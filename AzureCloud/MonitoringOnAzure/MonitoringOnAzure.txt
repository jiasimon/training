Exercise - sample application environment


Set up the sample microservice application

You have no storage mounted
Azure Cloud Shell requires an Azure file share to persist files.

Azure Cloud Shell will register your subscription with Microsoft.CloudShell resource provider.


git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-monitoring-java
cd mslearn-monitoring-java
code deployPetClinicApp.sh


Type "az" to use Azure CLI
Type "help" to learn about Cloud Shell

Storage fileshare subscription 63dfb9ff-f0ae-457e-b369-d1e602f0c472 is not registered to Microsoft.CloudShell Namespace. Please follow these instructions "https://aka.ms/RegisterCloudShell" to register. In future, unregistered subscriptions will have restricted access to CloudShell service.

Test the application
Next, we'll verify your environment via the Azure portal.
	1. Open the Azure portal
	2. Select "Azure Spring Apps" from the list of Azure services
	3. Select your Azure Spring Apps instance
	4. On the right-hand side, select "Apps" under settings
	5. Verify all the applications are running and registered

Log streaming
az spring app logs --name <application> --resource-group <resource group name> --service <service instance name> -f

Tail log
az spring app logs -f --name customers-service


az spring app logs -f --name customers-service --instance customers-service-default-17-7bc5f9dd79-fshb9

az spring app logs --name customers-service

Continuously stream new logs
az spring app logs --name customers-service -f


az spring app logs --name customers-service -f



Monitor the Application with Azure Application Insights
Application Map helps you spot performance bottlenecks or failure hot-spots across all components of your distributed application.
